# kdb
Let's build a simple database. 

First, this is my dream for a long term, i have been working on storage field for many years. 

Second, this will help me learn java again and go through this hard time.

Third, kdb is one of my favorite football players, kevin de bruyne, he is a great player and i learn a lot from him. The most import thing is if we want to know every piece of details in the field, we should keep looking and thinking. I think i should do like this in the life.
